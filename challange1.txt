A 3 tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these resources. Please remember we will not be judged on the outcome but more focusing on the approach, style and reproducibility.


Steps:

1) Cretae the docker file execute the below file to create the image.

GCP Project: test-app

  
  docker build -t gcr.io/test-app/three-tier-app:v1.0 .
  docker push gcr.io/test-app/three-tier-app:v1.0

creating the yamls to deploy the three-tier-app application via k8s.

1) Create the GKE cluster in GCP or you can deploy locally mini kube.(Using mini kube you can't deploy external LB).

    I have created standard zonal GKE cluster to deploy the below application.

1) created the deployment.yaml and service.yaml (with external loadbalancer).
   deployment.yaml
   service.yaml
